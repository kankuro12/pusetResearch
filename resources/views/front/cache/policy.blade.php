                We mandate that the author, peer reviewers, editors, and editorial staff disclose any possible conflicts of interest pertaining to the article and the publication procedure. We encourage authors to utilize the Conflict-of-Interest Disclosure Form developed by ICMJE, http://www.icmje.org/ known as the Uniform Disclosure Form for Potential Conflicts of Interest, to promote a consistent approach in making such declarations.
